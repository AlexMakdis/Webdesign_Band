Live At The Grand Olympic Auditorium (DVD)
Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium is the second live album by the American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine , released on November 25, 2003 by Epic Records. It is a recording of two shows Rage played at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in their hometown of Los Angeles on September 12 and 13, 2000. The album was originally planned to be released in November 2000, but was delayed due to the break-up of the band shortly after the September concerts.
It was then slated for release a year later, but was again delayed due to the formation of Audioslave by the remaining three members of Rage (Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk) with vocalist Chris Cornell. The album was released amid mixed reviews in November 2003, mainly due to poor mixing rather than musical performance, where on the other hand the DVD version was praised by fans and critics alike.
